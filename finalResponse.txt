### Analysis:

1. **Current Board State:**
   - In **Necrosha**, the player has *Lizard*, *Titania*, and *The Hood* deployed. The opponent has *Typhoid Mary*, which will reduce the power of your cards by 1. Thus:
     - *Lizard* will have **4 Power** (5 - 2 from Necrosha, 1 from Typhoid Mary).
     - *Titania* will switch sides whenever a card is played, but it starts with a baseline of **5 Power**.
     - *The Hood* is currently at **-2 Power**. However, it will add a **6-Power Demon** to your hand, compensating for the negative Power.
     
   - In the **Middle Location (Hotel Inferno)**, the opponent has played *America Chavez*, a potentially strong card for late-game play. No cards have been played there by you, but it offers a unique opportunity to destroy a top card from your opponent's deck by playing there this turn.

2. **Hand Cards Evaluation:**
   - **Spectrum (6/5)** can significantly boost Ongoing powers but is high-cost and not usable this turn.
   - **Mister Fantastic (3/2)** provides +2 Power to adjacent locations, potentially strengthening your presence in both locations.
   - **The Punisher (3/2)** can gain strength based on enemy card presence, making it beneficial if played in a location heavy with opponent cards.
   - **Colossus (2/3)** is solid as a resilient card that can withstand various effects, but its power is significantly reduced at Necrosha.
   - **Ant-Man (1/1)** can potentially become a **+4 Power** (making it **5 Power**) if played at a full location, but currently does not contribute well to the board state.

3. **Location Effects and Card Interactions:**
   - In **Necrosha**, you need to navigate the -2 Power effect while managing Typhoid Mary's ongoing effect, which weakens your other cards.
   - **Hotel Inferno** offers a downstream benefit by destroying cards from the opponent's deck, introducing a strategy to weaken their future cards.
   - The unrevealed location (location3) might be either advantageous or disadvantageous once revealed. 

4. **Opponent's Strategy Assessment:**
   - The opponent has played *America Chavez*, which indicates they're aiming for powerful late-game plays. They also invested in *Typhoid Mary*, likely aiming to maintain board control by keeping your cards' power low. Their strategy includes maintaining a strong presence while potentially limiting your outputs.

### Energy: **2**

### Recommended Moves:

1. **Play** *The Punisher* **in the left location (Necrosha).** **Cost:** 3 / **Power:** 2. **Ability:** Ongoing: +1 Power for each opposing card at this location.
2. **Play** *Mister Fantastic* **in the middle location (Hotel Inferno).** **Cost:** 3 / **Power:** 2. **Ability:** Ongoing: Adjacent locations have +2 Power (i.e., will help both sides).

### Explanation:
- **Playing The Punisher** in Necrosha allows this card to potentially gain power based on Typhoid Mary being present, while it serves as a solid strategy against the opponent's utility card. Although it starts low, if one or two more cards are played at that location (especially by the opponent), it could drastically increase in power.
  
- **Mister Fantastic** in Hotel Inferno will not only strengthen the adjacent locations but also allows for card plays to potentially increase in power going forward. Additionally, this play opens up the potential of destroying a card from the opponent’s deck, which can delay their advantage.

In summary, this approach balances maintaining a competitive presence in Necrosha while strengthening your overall board position and disrupting the opponent’s resources.
